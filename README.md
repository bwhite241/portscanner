This is a basic TCP Connect port scanner written in Python3 that was created while attending a cybersecurity bootcamp. The purpose of this application is to detect open ports (1 - 10,000) on a selected site.  The banner was modified to include my information and a brief description of the application.  It has been tested successfully (within Kali Linux) on sites such as "scanme.nmap.org"
